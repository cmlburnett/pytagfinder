pytagfinder

This library looks for tags placed on files by Mac's Finder.
Currently this library is only tested under Linux.

### Tags ###
In Finder, tags are placed on files to give meaning as the user sees fit.
The default tags are colors (Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Purple, Gray), but anything can be used.

Finder prefers to store this information in extended attributes (xattr):

If unable, then it stores them in .DS_Store files.
This library only supports xattr at this time.


### Installation ###

sudo python3 setup.py install

### Usage ###

As a python library, the main function I wrote this for is findtag()

	import tagfinder
	found = tagfinder.findtag('/some/path', 'Orange')

and it returns all files, recursively found, with the tag 'Orange' (default is 'Red').

Alternatively, as a command line tool:

	$ python3 -m findtag -t Orange /some/path

or to get as JSON list

	$ python3 -m findtag -j -t Orange /some/path
